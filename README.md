# Discord bot
## My first project working with Node.js creating a discord bot.
Bots on Discord "the group messaging platform" are helpful artificial intelligence that can perform several useful tasks on your server automatically. That includes welcoming any new members, banning troublemakers, and moderating the discussion. Some bots even add music or games to your server. My Discord bot coded in JavaScript with Discord.js.
Discord.js is a powerful node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.
