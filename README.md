# Discord bot
## 📌 My first project working with Node.js creating a discord bot.
Bots on Discord "A group messaging platform" are helpful artificial intelligence that can perform several useful tasks on your server automatically. My Discord bot coded in JavaScript with Discord.js.\
Discord.js is a powerful node.js module that allows you to interact with the Discord API very easily. It takes a much more object-oriented approach than most other JS Discord libraries, making your bot's code significantly tidier and easier to comprehend.
